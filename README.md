This repository contains the source files and assets used to create some of the artworks showcased on [my Instagram @iamkidev](https://www.instagram.com/iamkidev)

## Projects  
I used [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) at some point in each project. I also either used direct pictures I took somewhere, or was inspired by it.  
For the projects not listed here, it's most likely that they were made entirely using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).
